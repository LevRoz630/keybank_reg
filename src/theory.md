Available-for-sale (AFS) securities show a strong negative correlation with interest rate increases. During 2022, U.S. commercial banks reported more than $500 billion in unrealized losses on their investment securities portfolios as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. This effect occurs because these securities are marked-to-market, making them particularly vulnerable to rate fluctuations. 
Four US banks grew their AFS securities portfolios by $119.1 billion (15.7%) in the third quarter, with JP Morgan accounting for $68.3 billion of this increase, indicating strategic portfolio adjustments in response to changing interest rate environments.
The correlation between interest rates and bank equity values also shows interesting patterns. Historically, a 100 basis point decrease in short-term rates increased bank stock prices by approximately 3.9% on average. However, this relationship reversed during periods of low and negative interest rates, where further cuts became detrimental to banks' equity valuesâ€”a 25 basis point surprise cut decreased bank stock prices by 2.0%. This suggests a "reversal rate" phenomenon where accommodative monetary policy becomes counterproductive for banks below certain threshold rates.
For held-to-maturity (HTM) securities, the correlation with interest rates differs from AFS securities. Since HTM securities are recorded at amortized cost rather than marked-to-market, their book values remain insulated from interest rate fluctuations. This makes HTM classification particularly valuable during periods of high interest rate volatility, as it reduces earnings volatility.
